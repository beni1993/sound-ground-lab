A collection of small tools to work on wave-files.

## Motivation

In the past I multiple times implemented small programms to read or write wave-files.
Now I had the idea to collect the tools and write a small toolchain, to modify wave-files
at the terminal.

## Install

* Ubuntu

First of all, I must create usefull tools. For the moment, you have to wait.

```sh
   Waiting...
```
